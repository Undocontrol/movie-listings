Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Running the project

Firstly, you will need to sign up to TMDB for an API Key: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
```
cd movie-listings
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

# Areas of improvement/To do

* The original aim was to filter the results by Genre and also by Rating (average votes). The approach was quite challenging 
and therefore I haven't had much time to finish this but only made a start. 
* I would loves to have been able to add some unit tests for this. 
* I also would have added a CSS-preprocessor like SASS or LESS.
